# My project

Welcome to worlds most complicated and most beautiful app.
The app has two buttons which, by pressing it, generates random figures- rock, scissor or paper.
Its a two player game or a one man show for the lonely ones. 
The app has no styling and looks accordingly. It consists of three elements, a header, a main section with the game itself and a footer.

The test files are located in the components folder.
